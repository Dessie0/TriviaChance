TriviaChance is a mobile app that combines two ideas: trivia and chance.

Players can play solo games to test their trivia skills or go online to compete against friends and see who can answer the most questions correctly.

When a game is completed, a bar will fill to a certain point, depending on how many questions the player got correct. When the bar reaches full, they will receive an unlock.

These unlocks can be used in the redemption activity, where using an unlock gives you a random chance to unlock a new theme for the app! New themes can be accessed from the inventory screen.
